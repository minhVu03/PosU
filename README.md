Make your Physiotherapy sessions fun!

Existing physiotherapy exercises that rely on visual simulations often require expensive VR headsets, making them out of reach for many people. That's why we created pOSU!â€”a web-based, motion-tracking web app that can run on any device with a simple webcam. We also wanted to make the experience feel fun and rewarding for users by introducing a point-based game system.

What it does
Using live motion-tracking through a webcam, pOSU!! guides users through a series of arm exercises by prompting them to move their arms in a specific sequence. Each movement is visually prompted with on-screen cues, and a point is awarded each time the user successfully completes an arm pose. The point system allows users to do physical rehabilitation exercises whilst engaging in a fun mini-game.

How to run it:

cd into posU and run 
```npm run dev```

open another terminal and run the back end:\\
cd into posU/posU/backend

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
```python main.py```
